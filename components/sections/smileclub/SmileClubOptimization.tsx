 * Smile Club — membership growth plan (rev. 2), the live rendering of

 * pilot; expand on evidence), reframes the diagnosis as testable
 * hypotheses, adds offer validation + contribution economics + capacity
 * as expansion gates, moves onboarding/activation into Wave 1, separates
 * the three corporate payment models, and requires an audience-eligibility
 * check before any patient-list ad targeting. Strategy content only — no
 * patient data; unknowns are marked "baseline pending", never invented.
